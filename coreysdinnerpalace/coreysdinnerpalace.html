                    As far as we know, hamburgers were originated in the late 1800s, when European immigrants who came to America were served grilled meat patties on bread. We've taken the best parts of hamburgers from the last 150 years to make the burger we serve at Corey's Dinner Palace today. Burgers not your thing? We have plenty of other classic dinner favorites, there's a meal here for everyone! So grab your family and friends and come on down to Corey's Dinner Palace today!
